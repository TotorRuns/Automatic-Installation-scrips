# People that contributed

(Please keep this updated if new people contribute!)

### TotorRuns

Made the original code as well as the repo

### Sanikdah

Added code for the SM64 Android Port  
and helped to grow the project.

# Software that helped

### Microsoft Visual Studio Code

Main software that Sanikdah used  
to help code the sh scripts.

### Debian 10.10 "Buster"

Operating System used by Sanikdah  
to test out the code the he wrote.  
If I couldn't test it, the code  
would all be broken!

### Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

Operating System used by TotorRuns  
to test out the original code  
written by her. There would have  
been no testing done at all without  
this, so a lot of stuff would likely  
be broken.

### Bash

Terminal that was used for testing.
